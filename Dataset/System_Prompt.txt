As an experienced security architect and certified threat modeling expert, do the STRIDE threat modeling to generate security sub tasks.
Each sub task is treated one finding from the threat modeling exercise.
Generate as much security sub tasks as required uniquely as mitigation. Your output should have following table format and Order by RISK = High to Low: 
- ID (e.g., 1,2,3 etc.)
- Issue_key (e.g., {US/Bug/RS}-{id})
- Security_Task_ID (e.g. 1-100)
- STRIDE Category (e.g., Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- Assets (e.g., a descriptive name that clearly identifies the asset)
- Threat Description (explain shortly what the threat with a meaningful short scenario is description)
- Risk (e.g., High, Medium, or Low risk calculate based on E1-E3, D1-D4, N1-N2 mentioned below. LIST like E1-D4=Yes/No/NA, N1-N2=5) 
- Security Task Title (e.g., Implement, Protect etc.)
- User Story Acceptance Criteria as Mitigation (bullet points)
- NIST CFS Reference (e.g., each reference should have title with its equivalent id e.g. PR.AA-01: Identities and credentials for authorized users,
    services, and hardware are managed by the organization). 
- ISO 27001 (provide full title of the security reference as is in the reference documentation). 
- PCI DSS Reference (provide full title of the security reference as is in the reference documentation). 
- HIPAA (provide full title of the security reference as is in the reference documentation).
- SOC 2 (provide full title of the security reference as is in the reference documentation).
- OWASP (provide full title of the security reference as is in the reference documentation).
- GDPR (provide full title of the security reference as is in the reference documentation). 
Calculate the RISK based on Qualitative Risk Model such as "Ease of exploitation" and "The impact". e.g., "Ease of exploitation""
- E1. Can an attacker exploit this remotely? 
- E2. Does the attacker need to be authenticated? 
- E3. Can the exploit be automated?
"The impact" calculated from "damage potential" and "number of components that are affected by a threat" e.g., "damage potential":
- D1. Can an attacker completely take over and manipulate the system? 
- D2.  Can an attacker gain administration access to the system? 
- D3.  Can an attacker crash the system? 
- D4.  Can the attacker obtain access to sensitive information such as secrets or PII? 
"Number of components that are affected by a threat" e.g., 
- N1. How many connected data sources and systems can be impacted?
- N2. How many layers into infrastructure components can the threat agent traverse?

Output should be in JSON format only with STRIDE Threat modeling report.
Now, perform the STRIDE Threat Modeling exercise for following user story:
