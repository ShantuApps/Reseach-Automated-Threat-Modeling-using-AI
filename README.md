## Repository Structure

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Contains the raw dataset and system configuration used in experiments:
- `Exported_From_Jira.csv` â€“ A dataset of 10 example user stories originally created as Jira issues and exported directly from Jira.  
- `System_Prompt.txt` â€“ The LLM system prompt used for automated threat modeling generation.  
- `User_Prompt.txt` â€“ The exact User Story used in this reseach to generate threat modeling outputs for reproducibility.  

> **Note**: The following user story was generated using AI from the *Add Photos & Files* feature by uploading **Figure 1** in ChatGPT-5, and is used in this research.

### ðŸ“‚ Figures
Figures included in the paper and supporting materials:
- `Figure_1_OWASP_Juice_Shop_Architecture_Diagram.png`  
- `Figure_2_System_Architecture_AI_Driven_Threat_Modeling.png`  
- `Figure_3_OWASP_Juice_Shop_Security_Tasks_ChatGPT5.png`  
- `Figure_4_OWASP_Juice_Shop_Compliance_Alignment_Mapping_ChatGPT5.png`  
- `Figure_5_AI_Output_in_JSON_Format.png`  

---

### ðŸ“‚ Outputs
Evaluation outputs from different models on the OWASP Juice Shop case study:
- `ChatGPT-5_OWASP_Juice_Shop.json`  
- `Gemini-Pro_OWASP_Juice_Shop.json`  
- `Gemini-Pro_OWASP_Juice_Shop.md`  

---

## Evaluation Setup

The dataset supports three research questions (RQ1â€“RQ3):

- **RQ1 â€“ Threat Classification Accuracy**  
  Each Jira item is annotated with expected **STRIDE categories**.

- **RQ2 â€“ Standards Compliance Coverage**  
  Security tasks mapped to major compliance frameworks:  
  *NIST CSF, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, OWASP ASVS, GDPR*.

- **RQ3 â€“ Workflow Integration**  
  Subtasks generated in **Jira-compatible structures** (titles, descriptions, acceptance criteria).
